 19- Run "python3 readHeartEmotion.py" which will categorize the emotions as detailed as half seconds like this;
     Line(1) 22.54.34.000 — 121 bpm — Excited
     Line(2) 22.54.34.005 — 121 bpm — Excited
     Line(3) 22.54.34.000 — 121 bpm — Excited
     Line(4) 22.54.34.005 — 121 bpm — Excited
     Line(5) 22.54.35.000 — 121 bpm — Excited
     Line(6) 22.54.35.005 — 121 bpm — Excited
     Line(7) 22.54.36.000 — 121 bpm — Excited
     Line(8) 22.54.36.005 — 121 bpm — Excited
     Line(9) 22.54.37.000 — 121 bpm — Excited
