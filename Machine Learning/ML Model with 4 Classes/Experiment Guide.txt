Experiment Notes
 1- Place "experiment_template" folder into C drive and name it with the persons name.
 2- Open the video on a different device, Xemotion on the smart phone and web camera of the laptop or PC at the same time.
 3- Start recording on Laptop or PC.
 4- Start tracking on Xemotion.
 5- Start the video on mobile device.
 6- Once the video ends, stop tracking on Xemotion.
 7- Move the lines created in "RoEmotion_ML_Training_Data" on mobile device to Laptop`s "{yourName}/Lines" folder located in C drive.
 8- Move the Laptop`s recorded webcam video to ""{yourName}" folder located in C drive and rename the file as "experiment.mp4".
 9- Open terminal and trigger "python3 face_recognition.py" file which will trigger the DeepFace Face-Based Emotion Recognition Algorithm.
 10- Once the process is complete, face_recognition.py will create an "emotions_log.txt" file which you should trigger another algorithm.
 11- Now on terminal trigger "python3 organize_lines_by_emotion.py" command.
 12- organize_lines_by_emotion.py will ask your name, when you must enter your name.
 13- organize_lines_by_emotion.py will create a "Classes" folder which you should carefully go back to "~/Machine Learning/ML Model with 4 Classes/data" and place the lines.
 14- Replace "train" and "val" folders there, which will put your line images.
 15- Once this process is done delete "{yourName}" on C drive.
 16- To train the Machine Learning Model, please locate to "~/Machine Learning/ML Model with 4 Classes" and read "Great Lakes Computers Training Instructions.txt".
