Experiment Notes
 1- Move the lines into "data" folder from smart phone.
 2- Create "Angry", "Anxious", "Sad" and "Excitement" classes.
 3- Look at the sliced video images at Dropbox file which supposed to look like this;
     Video_Slice (1) to Video_Slice (170) - "Razor From Need For Speed Most Wanted Game Confronts You" - Angry
     Video_Slice (170) to Video_Slice (318) - "You are being chased by police in Need For Speed Most Wanted Game" - Anxious
     Video_Slice (318) to Video_Slice (446) - "Bumblebee`s Best Friend is Killed By Decepticons in Transformers" - Sad
     Video_Slice (446) to Video_Slice (600) - "Rodimus Prime Beats Galvatron in Transformers G1" - Excitement
 4- Make sure the number of lines are equally distributed in data folder. Delete unnecessary lines that exceeds 600 lines or causing imbalance.
 5- Distribute classes into "train" and "val" as 70% of them should be "train" and 30% of them should be "val".
 6- Upload the data to the Great Lakes Clusters and read "Great Lakes Guidelines" to continue with this experiment.
